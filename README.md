- Mini Lab 4 (FrontEnd)

## Lab Setup
You can choose to clone this lab or, alternatively, you may copy and paste the content of index.html into a Mozilla Thimble file.

## Instructions:
The index.html file contains a very basic webpage template with the Bootstrap source files included.

You will create the rows and columns necessary to display content.

1. Visit https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/layout/grid/, and scroll down to Auto Layout columns.
2. The example file contains code for both autolayout for TWO AND THREE column layout.
3. Copy and paste the code for ONLY THE THREE COLUMN LAYOUT. Not both.
4. Paste your code into the body of your index.html page, before the <script> tags.
5. Ensure you have closed all of the DIVs by checking your indentation.

Now to add content to each DIV you have created:
1. Add text to one of the DIVs.
2. Add an image to another one of the DIVs.
3. Add a button to the last DIV. See https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/components/buttons/ for how to add Bootstrap buttons.
 

Finally, we want to add color to each DIV:
1. Add a different ID to each DIV. For instance: `<div id="container1" class="col">`
2. In between the <style> tags at the top of the page, give each container a background color.
3. Ensure you use a color scheme that we have learned before. Use Paletton or work from a previous lab to add your colors.

Now, we want to add a second row:
1. Under your first row, add a second row with a different set of columns.
2. For extra credit, use fixed width columns instead of auto-sizing columns.
3. Color and add content to each DIV in this row just as you did for the first row.
